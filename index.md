Different ways of displaying data on maps
-----------------------------------------

These examples explore different visualisations for the same dataset of payments from the North Riding of Yorkshire.

- the [choropleth]({% link choropleth.md %}) technique colours in the parish depending on number of Royalists / Parliamentarians.
- the [clusters]({% link leafletclusters.md %}) technique allows you to zoom in and see payment details on a pop-up. Because of the  clusters you **can't** see the spread of Royalists / Parliamentarians until you zoom in.
- the [dots]({% link dots.md %}) example shows one dot per payment but as many have the same location they are stacked and so you **can't** see the number of Royalists / Parliamentarians.
- the [bubbles]({% link bubbles.md %}) example uses the size of bubbles to show the number of Royalists / Parliamentarians at each location.
- the [dots plus forced layout]({% link dotsforced.md %}) example uses smaller dots and applies forces so they donâ€™t overlap but cluster *near* the location.

NB. The choropleth uses the **parish** for location; all the others use the **lat/lng**.
